## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Semantic UI
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project helped me learn about the 'negative spread' in CSS for box shadow. I learnt HTML5
and CSS3 before but did not have a project, so this was a good start. I learnt how to use custom CSS properties on top of Semantic UI which was interesting to say the least.
 

### Continued development

I have thought of moving to Styled Components since I know some custom styling is still needed
in this project which might not be possible with Semantic UI or might not know that specific
topic in Semantic UI.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12798902/box-shadow-for-bottom-side-only) - This helped me for the box shadowing part. Will be using this and learning more.
- [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com) - CSS library.
- [FrontendMentor Discord App] - Helped me with getting my background image positioned properly.
